# CTR-prediction

# Project Outline

1. **Data Exploration**
   - a. Provide a high-level overview of the dataset.
   - b. Identify any anomalies, missing data, or inconsistencies, and describe how you address them.
   - c. Visualize the data to uncover patterns, distributions, or correlations that could impact the CTR.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - a. Justify the  choice of features and any transformations applied.

3. **Modeling**
   - a. Train at least one regression model to predict CTR.
   - b. Compare different modeling approaches if time allows (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Linear Regression).
   - c. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
